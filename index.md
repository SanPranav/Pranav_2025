    <p>Hi, I am Pranav Santhosh, a Freshman at Del Norte High School. I am currently 15 years old and have a passion for computer science and software engineering. I enjoy playing badminton and engaging in various other activities. One of my hobbies is playing games, although I don't play them very often.</p>
    <p>I come from a family of five, which includes my brother, mother, sister, father, and me. As the oldest child in my family, I take on a lot of responsibilities and strive to set a good example for my siblings.</p>
    <p>My interest in coding started at a young age, and I have been pursuing it ever since. I have already completed CSSE 1 and CSSE 2, which have provided me with a strong foundation in computer science. These courses have made it easier for me to navigate through more advanced topics and projects.</p>
    <p>In order to further my knowledge and skills, I have enrolled in the CS SE Class. I am excited to continue my journey in computer science and look forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for updates and insights into my progress and experiences as I explore the world of computer science and software engineering.</p>
