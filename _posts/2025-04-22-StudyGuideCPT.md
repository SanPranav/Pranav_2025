# My AP CSP Create Performance Task (CPT) Guide

## Project Overview

This page documents my journey through the AP CSP Create Performance Task, including resources that helped me succeed, documentation of my process, and the final project submission.

## My CPT Project

### Project Video
Attempt 1:
<video controls style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;">
    <source src="images/CSPFinalVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
Attempt 2:
<video controls style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;">
    <source src="images/CSPFinalVideo(1).mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
Attempt 3:
<video controls style="max-width: 800px; height: auto;">
    <source src="images/CSPFinalVideo(2).mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

*Note: I had to increase the speed of the video to ensure it met the time limit while still showcasing all the required components effectively. This adjustment allowed me to create a submission that was concise yet comprehensive enough to fulfill the AP CSP requirements.*

### Development Process
I approached my CPT by following these key steps:

1. **Planning**: Brainstormed ideas that would meet all CPT requirements while showcasing my programming skills
2. **Designing**: Created wireframes and pseudocode to map out my program's structure
3. **Implementation**: Coded the program, focusing on incorporating the required algorithms and abstractions
4. **Testing**: Debugged and refined my code, ensuring everything worked correctly
5. **Documentation**: Prepared written responses and video demonstration

### CPT Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Program with purpose and function
- [ ] Input and output demonstration
- [ ] Algorithm implementation with sequencing, selection, and iteration
- [ ] List/collection with at least one iteration
- [ ] Student-developed procedure with parameter
- [ ] Abstraction implementation
- [ ] Video demonstration (under 1 minute)
- [ ] Written responses addressing all prompts

### Mr. Mortenson's Guides

Mr. Mortenson provided several valuable resources that helped me prepare for the CPT:

* Sample projects demonstrating effective implementations
* Rubric breakdowns explaining exactly what AP graders look for
* Feedback sessions on early drafts

His step-by-step approach to meeting the CPT requirements was especially helpful in ensuring I addressed all components of the task.

### Trimester Two Preparation Group

I'm grateful to have collaborated with the Trimester Two preparation group who:

* Organized peer review sessions where we evaluated each other's projects
* Shared successful CPT examples from previous years
* Created a collaborative document of common pitfalls to avoid
* Hosted mock grading sessions to understand the scoring process

Their insights on how to clearly demonstrate algorithms and abstractions were particularly valuable in shaping my final submission.

## Tips for Success

Based on my experience, here are some recommendations for future students:

* Start early and plan thoroughly
* Focus on clearly demonstrating the required elements
* Keep your code organization clean and well-commented
* Practice explaining your code verbally before recording
* Have peers review your work against the rubric
* Make sure your video clearly shows all required components

## Reflection

The CPT process was both challenging and rewarding. It taught me the importance of planning, iterative development, and clear documentation. By breaking the task into smaller steps, I was able to focus on each requirement and ensure my project met the AP CSP standards. I also learned how to effectively communicate my program's purpose and functionality through both written responses and a video demonstration.

To deepen my understanding of the process, I plan to create an entirely new CPT project from scratch. This will allow me to explore different programming concepts, experiment with new algorithms, and refine my approach to abstraction and documentation. By repeating the process, I can further solidify my skills and gain more confidence in tackling complex programming tasks.
