# CSP Study Action Plan

## Learning Style Assessment

I've reflected on my learning style for technical topics and identified that I learn best through:
- **Visual learning**: Diagrams, charts, and visual representations help me grasp complex concepts
- **Practical application**: Implementing concepts in code reinforces my understanding
- **Interactive learning**: Discussing problems with peers and working through examples

## Action Items for Improved Study

### 1. Enhance Visual Content
- Create or find diagrams for key algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal)
- Develop visual flowcharts for complex processes
- Add more visual representations beyond the Big O notation chart
- Use color-coding for important concepts and relationships

### 2. Diversify Learning Resources
- **Videos**: Watch 2-3 YouTube tutorials weekly on challenging topics
  - Channels: Computerphile, MIT OpenCourseWare, Abdul Bari for algorithms
- **Interactive coding**: Complete practice problems on LeetCode/HackerRank (3 problems per week)
- **Reading**: Supplement with textbook chapters and online documentation

### 3. PPR Focus Areas (Performance Pattern Recognition)
- Dedicate 2 hours weekly specifically to PPR questions
- Create flashcards for common patterns and their implementations
- Build a personal library of pattern solutions and practice variations
- Focus on optimizing from 68/70 to perfect score

### 4. CPT Preparation (Create Performance Task)
- Review previous successful CPT submissions for structure
- Practice explaining my algorithm choices in written form
- Prepare responses to potential questions about:
  - Algorithm efficiency and Big O analysis
  - Design decisions and alternatives considered
  - Program functionality and purpose
  - Code segments that demonstrate specific requirements

## Progress Tracking
- Weekly self-assessment on key topics
- Keep an error log to identify recurring mistakes
- Document concepts that need reinforcement
- Adjust study focus based on performance trends
