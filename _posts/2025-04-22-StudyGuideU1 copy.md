# AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) Study Guide - Unit 1

## BIG IDEA 1: CREATIVE DEVELOPMENT

### 1.1 Program Design and Development
- **Program Purpose**: Identifying the goals and intended uses of a program
- **Program Design**: Creating algorithms, flowcharts, and pseudocode
- **Incremental Development**: Building and testing programs in small, functional pieces
- **Collaboration Tools**: Using version control systems (Git), pair programming techniques
- **Documentation**: Creating readable code with comments and documentation

### 1.2 Program Abstraction
- **Procedural Abstraction**: Creating modular code with functions/procedures
- **Data Abstraction**: Using variables, data structures, and APIs
- **Levels of Abstraction**: Understanding abstraction from high-level languages to binary
- **Hiding Implementation Details**: Creating clean interfaces and APIs
- **Parameters and Return Values**: Passing and returning data in functions

### 1.3 Program Design and Implementation
- **Problem-Solving Strategies**: Breaking down complex problems
- **Algorithm Design**: Creating step-by-step solutions
- **Programming Language Features**: Variables, control structures, functions
- **Libraries and APIs**: Using pre-built tools and frameworks
- **Testing and Validation**: Ensuring program correctness

### 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
- **Types of Errors**: Syntax, logic, and runtime errors
- **Debugging Techniques**: Print statements, debuggers, tracing
- **Testing Strategies**: Boundary cases, edge cases, normal cases
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks and error messages
- **Code Review**: Collaborative error finding and fixing
