# Computer Science Portfolio - Year in Review

## 1. Project Overview & Technical Contributions

Throughout this academic year, I've developed expertise in **full-stack development**, **agile methodologies**, and **team leadership** through two major projects: **Pyre** and **Prism**.

### Pyre - Earthquake Monitoring Platform

As **Scrum Master** for the earthquake monitoring team, I led project coordination while developing critical features:

**Help Center**: Built a comprehensive user support system with *searchable documentation*, *multimedia support*, and *integrated ticketing*. Implemented intelligent search algorithms for natural language queries and automated issue routing.
