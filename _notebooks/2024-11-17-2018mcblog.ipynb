    "As I continue to refine my work, Sprint 3 has been an important milestone in enhancing both the functionality and user interface (UI) of my project. This review highlights the improvements made, the code that supports it, and how it all contributes to the overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## UI Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "For Sprint 3, I focused on enhancing the **navigation menu** and **debate selection interface** to ensure a smoother experience for users. Below is an overview of the user interface, showcasing the **sidebar** and **main debate selection area**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation Menu:\n",
    "The code is too large for this page so let's take a look at it from the original repository. Here is an image of the menu instead!\n",
    "![Submenu](../images/submenu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I Added This Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to add custom styling to the table to ensure that the navigation menu would not only function smoothly but also look visually appealing. The **hover effects** and **box shadows** help give the menu a modern, interactive feel, while the **color transitions** maintain the consistency of the site's design. The **blue accent color** reflects the overall branding, making the interface feel cohesive and polished.\n",

    "![UI](../images/UI.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I Added This Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "This code structure ensures that the user can **select debate topics**, **submit arguments**, and **view arguments** with ease. The **sidebar** with clickable debate buttons helps users quickly navigate between debates, while the **rule bar** ensures users are always reminded of the platform's community rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **model** popup improves the UI flow by informing users of important guidelines before participating. The **submit button** and **textarea** for argument input are crucial for interactivity, enabling users to express their opinions. The **argument list** section helps create a dynamic interaction as users submit and view responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Summary and Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sprint 3, I implemented interactive UI elements and added engaging features to the debate platform. The **navigation menu** was designed to be intuitive, with an emphasis on style and user interaction. The **debate selection interface** further enhanced the user experience by making it easy to choose a debate topic, submit an argument, and view ongoing discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding these pieces of code, I was able to contribute significantly to the site's functionality and aesthetics. The smooth **hover effects**, **modal popups**, and **dynamic layout** all work together to create an enjoyable user experience. I’m pleased with the progress made in this sprint, and the code improvements have made the platform both visually appealing and functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, I’ll continue to refine the UI and add more interactive features to enhance engagement. Keep an eye out for upcoming sprints that will bring even more improvements!\n",
