    "### System Info (Image 1):\n",
    "- Go to the terminal to access the machine.\n",
    "- Now go to Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS & Routing:\n",
    "- Anvay handled this part to find our **route, type, alias, and IP address** to locate our Prism service.\n",
    "- **IP address** is a way to register our address.\n",
    "- Right now, we are on an **intranet**.\n",
    "  - **Intranet** = local to campus.\n",
    "  - **Internet** = external/global.\n",
    "- Anvay already got the **DNS** set up.\n",
    "- The websites are already assigned.\n",
    "- We have **different names for different servers**.\n",
    "- One of us has to handle this (**Anvay, the nonchalant sigma**).\n",
    "- **Current setup:**\n",
    "  - We should have a **subdomain**: `Prism`.\n",
    "  - Then, we type our **IP address** (Anvay’s thing).\n",
    "- **Make sure the IP address is the exact same.**\n",
    "- **Funny Moment:** The sub heard **PRISON instead of PRISM** \n",
    "- **Final step:** Ensure a **friendly address** is registering to our IP name.\n",
    "  - Often, we call these our **domain names**, but it’s actually our **URL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding What We Did:\n",
    "- Everybody there?\n",
    "- **What did we just do?**\n",
    "  - This is a **database**, and we created an **A record** called `Prism`.\n",
    "  - This maps to an **IP address**.\n",
    "  - We have a bunch of **nonhumans** in our class (`studybuddy` and `prism team` are normal).\n",
    "  - **DNS maps record names to computers.**\n",
    "  - If it's a **named service record**, it looks through other routes to understand the rest of the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS Setup:\n",
    "1. Go to **EC2**.\n",
    "2. On EC2, go to **Instances Running** and scroll to the right to find the **Elastic IP**.\n",
    "3. **We created a machine on AWS that has its own IP.**\n",
    "4. Now, we’ll **launch a new instance**:\n",
    "   - Name it `xxx`.\n",
    "   - Pick **Operating System**.\n",
    "   - Choose **Micro/Nano** instance type.\n",
    "   - Set **disk size**, then click **Launch Instance**.\n",
    "5. **Reminder:** Every one of these hardware instances **costs money per hour**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- **Permissions:** We **don’t** give blanket permissions.\n",
    "- **Backend Setup:**\n",
    "  - Talks about **fetches** and **directories**.\n",
    "  - **\"Better than candy\"** (??).\n",
    "  - We need to **clone ours**—only **one person** has to do it.\n",
    "  - **Stick with the naming convention.**\n",
