    "|----------|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Q4** | Arithmetic Operations | A (37) | **C (26)** | Forgot order of operations - multiplication happens before addition in first line, modulus happens before addition in second line | Operator precedence: `*` and `%` before `+` | `first = 5 + 10 * 2 = 25` (not 30), then `second = 25 + 25 % 2 = 26` (not 37) |\n",
    "| **Q7** | String Methods - substring | A | **B** | Didn't correctly calculate substring indices | `substring(start, end)` goes from index `start` to `end-1` | `substring(4)` = \"HI\" (index 4 to end), `substring(0,2)` = \"DE\" (index 0-1). Result: \"HI\" + \"DE\" = \"HIDE\" |\n",
    "| **Q8** | Type Casting & Division | B (0.0, 0.4) | **C (0.4, 0.0)** | Mixed up which operation casts first | Casting happens BEFORE the operation when using `(type)` | `y = (int) w / x` → casts w to 2, then divides: 2.0/5.0 = 0.4. `z = (int)(w/x)` → divides first (0.4), then casts to 0 |\n",
    "| **Q10** | Conditional Logic - if/else | B | **A** | Incorrectly traced through nested if-else logic | Else-if chain evaluation order | Score 250: first if is false (250 ≤ 250), goes to else-if which is true (250 ≤ 500), assigns \"Try again\" |\n",
    "| **Q11** | Dot Operator & Methods | B | **A** | Confused method call syntax with object | Dot operator calls instance methods on objects | Correct: `myPair.getX()` - call method on object. Wrong: `myPair.getX(x)` or `myPair.x` |\n",
    "| **Q15** | String Methods in Loops | B | **A** | Didn't trace loop correctly with substring operations | `substring(j)` returns from index j to end, `indexOf()` finds first occurrence | Loop prints each occurrence of \"o\" with following characters: \"ookout okout out\" |\n",
    "| **Q21** | Nested For Loops | C | **B** | Got inner loop bounds wrong | Inner loop must iterate based on outer loop variable | Need `k = 0; k <= j; k++` so that iteration 0 prints 1 value, iteration 1 prints 2 values, etc. |\n",
    "| **Q24** | ArrayList add/set Methods | D | **B** | Confused `add(index, value)` with `set(index, value)` behavior | `add(index, value)` inserts at index, `set(index, value)` replaces | `add(0, 300)` inserts at beginning. `set(2, 400)` replaces index 2. Result: [300, 100, 400, 500] |\n",
    "| **Q26** | While Loop Logic | B | **A** | Didn't correctly identify loop termination condition | Loop continues while condition is TRUE | Current code uses `n > 0` but should use `n / 10 > 0` to stop when leftmost digit is reached |\n",
    "| **Q30** | Nested Conditionals | A | **D** | Didn't properly trace nested if-else with multiple conditions | Use `&&` for compound conditions, trace each branch carefully | Need `(a <= b && a <= c)` to check if a is minimum, then nested check for b vs c |\n",
    "| **Q32** | 2D Array Traversal | A | **B** | Got loop iteration direction backwards | Traverse 2D arrays right-to-left, top-to-bottom for this pattern | Outer loop: rows 0→1 (forward). Inner loop: columns from `mat[0].length - 1` down to 0 (backward) |\n",
    "| **Q34** | ArrayList vs Enhanced For Loop | D | **B** | Used wrong method to build ArrayList from iteration | Enhanced for-each loops can't modify/build collections easily | Need traditional for loop with index to add elements: `for (String s : oldList) { newList.add(s); }` |\n",
    "| **Q35** | Array Sorting Logic | C | **D** | Misread return value logic | Method returns boolean based on sorted order check | Returns `true` if sorted from greatest to least (each element ≤ previous), `false` otherwise |\n",
    "| **Q36** | 2D Array Traversal & Assignment | D | **B** | Confused row/column traversal order | Outer loop controls rows, inner loop controls columns | Code traverses rows forward (r = 0→0), columns backward (c from length-1 down), checks diagonal |\n",
    "| **Q38** | Scanner & ArrayList Building | B | **C** | Didn't use correct Scanner method to split strings | `split()` is a String method, Scanner uses `next()` | Use `String temp = sc.next().split(\",\")` to read and split each line, then add temp[0] to first list and temp[1] to second |\n",
    "| **Q41** | Array Traversal & String Comparison | C (4) | **D (5)** | Off-by-one error in loop logic | Loop iterates through colors array comparing lengths | The loop finds the first pair of adjacent strings with equal length. \"black\" and \"yellow\" both have length 6, at indices 3 and 4, so k=4 which is returned as result=5 |\n",
    "| **Q42** | While to For Loop Conversion | A | **D** | Didn't account for when loop variable is incremented | While loop increments `j` twice per iteration; for loop only increments once in header | While loop: `j++` (in body) then `sum += j`, so adds 1,3,5. For loop equivalent: start at 1, increment by 2: `for (int j = 1; j <= 6; j+=2)` with just `sum += j` |\n",

    "## Coolest Discovery: Gemini Grading Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini was grading inconsistently - the same answer would get different scores on different attempts. Consistency was only around 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models are probabilistic, not deterministic. Even identical inputs can produce different outputs because of how language models generate text (they sample from probability distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Changes:**\n",
    "1. Set temperature parameter to 0 (most deterministic setting)\n",
    "2. Use structured output format (JSON only)\n",
    "3. Provide detailed rubrics in prompt\n",
    "4. Include 3 example answers with scores in prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Result\n",
    "\n",
    "This single discovery transformed our grading system from \"interesting experiment\" to \"actually usable tool.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how models work lets you engineer better solutions. \n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Sprint Taught Me\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Growth:**\n",
    "- full-stack development with AI integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration:**\n",
    "- admin/analytics required coordination\n",
    "- Code reviews improved quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Sprint Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-based grading and standardized question formats."
