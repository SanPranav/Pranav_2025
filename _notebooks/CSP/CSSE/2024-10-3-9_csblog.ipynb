    "# What I Learned from the Girls in CS Panel\n",

    "> A reflection on insights from college students Michael Hayes, Tanisha Patel, Aadit Mathur, and Neha on navigating CS, building skills, and finding your path.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **There's No Single Path Into CS**\n",
    "The panelists came from different backgrounds—some switched majors, others started late, and many discovered CS through unexpected hobbies like Legos, photography, or design. What mattered most was reflection and self-awareness about what drives you, not having it all figured out early.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **High School Classes & ECs Build Real Skills**\n",
    "AP classes, CS courses, and clubs aren't just resume builders. They develop time management, communication, and problem-solving skills that transfer directly to college and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Break Big Problems Into Small Steps**\n",
    "Everyone emphasized iteration, timelines, scrum/kanban boards, and focusing on one small piece at a time. This skill—breaking complex problems into manageable chunks—is essential in real-world CS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Project Ideas Come From Real Life**\n",
    "Notice problems around you. Do user interviews, build a small MVP, and improve based on feedback. The best ideas solve actual problems people face.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Communication Is As Important As Coding**\n",
    "Being able to explain your code, write clear comments, document your work, and focus on user impact matters just as much as the technical implementation. This is crucial in team environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **College Essays Don't Need to Be Super Technical**\n",
    "Many panelists focused on impact, curiosity, resilience, or community rather than just CS skills. Admissions officers want to understand *who you are*, not just what you can code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Project-Based Learning (PBL) Is Extremely Valuable**\n",
    "It teaches initiative, collaboration, and how real-world software is actually built. Mr. Mortenson's classes exemplify this approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Take Advantage of Opportunities Early**\n",
    "Network, talk to people in industry, try new things, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. These connections and experiences compound over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Panel Insights: Q&A Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Inspired Your Major Choice?**\n",
    "- **Neha** wanted pre-law until reflection showed CS was a better fit\n",
    "- **Aadit** built Legos as a kid and stayed interested in tech through high school\n",
    "- **Michael** loved the creative satisfaction of filmmaking and found the same in CS\n",
    "- **Tanisha** was drawn to the environment and curriculum at Del Norte\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What ECs & Activities Helped?**\n",
    "- **Neha**: AP classes for critical thinking, writing, and communication\n",
    "- **Aadit**: CyberPatriot for computer comfort; rigorous coursework built time management\n",
    "- **Michael**: Del Norte's communication emphasis and an internship at SDSU startup incubator taught him to translate tech for non-technical audiences\n",
    "- **Tanisha**: CSSE, CSP, and CSA programs provided comprehensive foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Do You Break Problems Into Small Steps?**\n",
    "All panelists use agile methodologies: iteration, timelines, kanban boards, scrum boards, and APIs. Michael highlighted designing APIs before writing code, while Tanisha broke ML problems into data, schema, and timeline components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Where Do Project Ideas Come From?**\n",
    "- **Neha**: Human-computer interaction and user research—put users first\n",
    "- **Aadit**: Internships assign tasks; observe everyday life for personal ideas\n",
    "- **Michael**: Customer interviews and MVP/prototype testing reveal what users actually need\n",
    "- **Tanisha**: Real-world problems in ML systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Did You Write About CS in College Essays?**\n",
    "Most focused on impact, community, curiosity, and resilience rather than technical details. Essays highlighted personal growth and initiative, not just coding skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Which High School Skills Transferred to College?**\n",
    "- Time management and collaboration\n",
    "- Grit and stress management\n",
    "- Public speaking and presentations\n",
    "- Initiative and project planning\n",
    "- Independent learning (Stack Overflow, ChatGPT, documentation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **On Code Communication & Collaboration**\n",
    "- Meaningful commit messages and high-quality comments are essential\n",
    "- Talking through code verbally helps ensure everyone is on the same page\n",
    "- Documentation shared across the team prevents knowledge silos\n",
    "- Focus on user impact rather than technical details when explaining projects\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Aadit**: Try your best in everything and have fun doing it. If you commit, you can achieve it—whether creating a company, landing an internship, or learning something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Michael**: Look for PBL courses over lecture-based ones. Explore opportunities outside your degree. Try new things.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tanisha**: Take advantage of project-based learning. Build connections at networking events. Talk to industry professionals and put yourself out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mr. Mortenson**: Work really hard in class so you still have time to enjoy life outside of class. Have fun with CS.\n",

    "## What This Means For Me\n",
    "\n",
    "This panel reinforced that CS success isn't about being a \"natural\" programmer from day one. It's about:\n",
    "- **Curiosity** over certainty\n",
    "- **Iteration** over perfection\n",
    "- **Communication** over isolation\n",
    "- **Real problems** over theoretical exercises\n",
