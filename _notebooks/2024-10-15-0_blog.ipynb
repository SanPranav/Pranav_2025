    "### Hack 3.1: Homework Hacks 3.1\n",
    "In this hack, we covered the basics of arithmetic operations in Python. We learned how to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations. This hack provided a solid foundation for understanding how to manipulate numerical data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.2: Homework Hacks 3.2\n",
    "This hack focused on advanced arithmetic operations and introduced us to concepts like exponentiation and floor division. We also explored the use of built-in mathematical functions to perform complex calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.4: Homework Hacks 3.4\n",
    "This hack focused on string manipulation techniques. We explored various methods to manipulate strings, including concatenation, slicing, and formatting. Understanding these techniques is crucial for handling text data effectively in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.6: Homework Hacks 3.6\n",
    "In this hack, we delved into data structures. We learned about lists, dictionaries, and sets, and how to use them to store and manipulate collections of data. This knowledge is essential for organizing and accessing data efficiently in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.7: Homework Hacks 3.7\n",
    "This hack introduced us to control flow statements. We covered if-else statements, loops, and how to use them to control the execution of code based on certain conditions. Mastering control flow is key to writing dynamic and responsive programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.8: Homework Hacks 3.8\n",
    "In this hack, we explored functions and modular programming. We learned how to define and call functions, pass arguments, and return values. This hack emphasized the importance of breaking down code into reusable and manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.10A: Homework Hacks 3.10A\n",
    "This hack focused on file handling in Python. We learned how to read from and write to files, handle exceptions, and work with different file formats. This is crucial for managing data persistence in applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hack 3.10B: Homework Hacks 3.10B\n",
    "In this hack, we explored working with external libraries and APIs. We learned how to install and use third-party libraries, make HTTP requests, and process JSON data. This hack highlighted the importance of leveraging external resources to extend the functionality of our programs."
