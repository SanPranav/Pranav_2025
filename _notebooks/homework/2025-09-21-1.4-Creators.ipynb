    "Question: What happens if you write int count = \"hello\";? Why does this fail, and why is this behavior actually helpful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "This fails because `\"hello\"` is a string, and you are trying to assign it to a variable of type `int`. In statically-typed languages like Java, variables have a specific type, and you cannot assign a value of a different type without explicit conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is helpful because it prevents type-related errors. For example, if you accidentally try to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric data, the compiler will catch the error at compile time, ensuring type safety and reducing runtime bugs."
