    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "### Compound assignment operators make code cleaner and more efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "- +=, -=, *=, /=, %= combine operations with assignment\n",
    "- ++ and -- are shorthand for incrementing/decrementing by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Rules for AP Exam:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable must exist before using compound operators\n",
    "- Integer division truncates (no decimals)\n",
    "- Only post-form (x++, x--) is tested on AP exam\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-world applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Game development (scores, health, counters)\n",
    "- Financial calculations (balances, interest)\n",
    "- Social media metrics (followers, engagement)\n",
    "- Fitness tracking (calories, steps, progress)"
