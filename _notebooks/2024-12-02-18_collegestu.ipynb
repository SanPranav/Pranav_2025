    "# Leveraging Insights from College Interviews for CSP Projects and Life  \n",
    "\n",
    "College interviews taught me a lot of practical strategies that I can use in my projects, education, and future career. These are some of the key takeaways from those interviews and how I think they can help me in CSP (Computer Science Principles) and in life. I'll also explain how I plan to use these ideas in my CS journey.  \n",

    "## **Key Insights from College Interviews**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mr. Mortenson**  \n",
    "- Career fairs are a great way to network and meet professionals.  \n",
    "- Flowcharts are super helpful for planning projects, and tools like **draw.io** make it easy to organize ideas.  \n",
    "- You should know your code inside and out, so you can explain every line if someone asks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **David Vasilev (Purdue)**  \n",
    "- Learning how to use hacking tools and the command prompt makes solving problems faster.  \n",
    "- Doing live reviews is like practicing for real design reviews and helps you explain your ideas better.  \n",
    "- Flowcharts and structured design reviews are must-haves when working in teams.  \n",
    "- Build a portfolio using tools like GitBooks to show off your projects when applying for internships or jobs.  \n",
    "- Joining clubs and using dual-enrollment credits can give you a head start in college.  \n",
    "- Always **comment on every single line of code** to make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images from David's Talk\n",
    "![David's Flowchart 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image1.jpg)\n",
    "![David's Flowchart 2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Michael Hayes (San Diego State)**  \n",
    "- Working on projects keeps you interested and focused.  \n",
    "- Learning to explain things clearly and tell a story makes your ideas easier to understand.  \n",
    "- Startups and internships on campus are great for gaining experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Vivian Ni (Colombia)**  \n",
    "- GitHub and repositories are crucial for teamwork and sharing projects.  \n",
    "- Learning hardware tools like Arduino and laser cutters can make your projects stand out.  \n",
    "- Portfolios, websites, and showcasing your work make a big difference in interviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Edwin Abraham (Purdue)**  \n",
    "- Coding is a must-have skill for engineers, no matter what field.  \n",
    "- Getting involved in clubs and using agile methods can improve teamwork and results.  \n",
    "- Researching schools and programs based on your major helps you make better choices for your future.  \n",

    "## **Applying These Lessons to CSP Projects and Life**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Structured Planning for Success**  \n",
    "For every CSP project, I’ll use **flowcharts** and **design reviews** to plan things out. Tools like **draw.io** will help me organize my ideas visually. For example, before starting a big coding project, I’ll map out how the program will work step by step. I can also use this method to plan my goals, like choosing a college or preparing for an internship.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Mastering Fundamentals**  \n",
    "I’ll make sure I understand every line of my CSP code and **comment on every single line**, as David suggested. This will not only help me but also make it easier for others to follow my work. Practicing live reviews will help me explain my ideas clearly and confidently, which is a great skill for interviews and teamwork.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Building and Showcasing Portfolios**  \n",
    "I plan to create a **GitHub portfolio** to show off my CSP projects, with clear descriptions and lessons learned. I’ll also use tools like GitHub Pages to make a personal website where I can share my journey and achievements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Embracing Interdisciplinary Skills**  \n",
    "I’ll experiment with tools like Arduino and laser cutters to combine hardware and software in my projects. For example, I could build a sensor-based project that collects data and displays it using a Python program. This will help me develop a mix of skills and stand out in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Networking and Communication**  \n",
    "I’ll start attending career fairs and joining clubs related to my interests. Practicing clear communication during design reviews and presentations will help me stand out. For example, when presenting a project plan, I’ll use simple and clear slides to explain my goals and solutions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Passion-Driven Growth**  \n",
    "I’ll focus on projects and clubs that align with what I love, like robotics or coding challenges. This will help me stay motivated and learn skills that I actually enjoy using. In CSP, I want to work on creative coding projects, like building interactive games or apps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Preparing for the Future of CS**  \n",
    "Coding isn’t just for CSP—it’s a skill I want to keep improving for life. I’ll dedicate time to learning advanced coding techniques and stay updated on tools and frameworks to remain competitive in the tech world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Researching and Choosing Opportunities Wisely**  \n",
    "I’ll take Edwin’s advice and research colleges, internships, and projects that match my strengths and interests. For example, I’ll look for programs that focus on both software development and hands-on hardware experience, so I can explore both fields.  \n",
    "\n",

    "![Proof of Me Being There]({{site.baseurl}}/images/image3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these lessons to CSP projects and beyond, I believe I can become a better problem-solver, build meaningful connections, and prepare myself for success in the tech world. These insights are like a guide for making the most of my education and career opportunities."
