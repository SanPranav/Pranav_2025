    "## 2.1 - Binary and Data Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Binary?**\n",
    "Computers store and process all data in **binary (0s and 1s)**. Each bit represents a state (on/off, true/false), and larger data is built from multiple bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Types in Binary**\n",
    "- **Text** – Encoded using **ASCII (7-bit) or Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32)**.\n",
    "- **Images** – Represented as pixels with **RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values**.\n",
    "- **Audio** – Stored as **digital sound waves**, sampled at regular intervals.\n",
    "- **Video** – A sequence of images (frames) with **audio and compression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Converting Data to Binary**\n",
    "- **Decimal to Binary**: Divide by 2, recording remainders.\n",
    "- **Binary to Decimal**: Multiply each bit by powers of 2 and sum the results.\n",
