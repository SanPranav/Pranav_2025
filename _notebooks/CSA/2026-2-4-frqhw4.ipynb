    "## How I Solved This Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Actually Happening\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem simulates a bird feeder where birds (and occasionally a bear) come to eat. The challenge is to model:\n",
    "1. **Part A:** What happens on a single day\n",
    "2. **Part B:** How many days the feeder can sustain visitors\n",
    "\n",
    "The key twist: 5% of the time a bear shows up and eats everything. Otherwise, normal birds visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A Solution: simulateOneDay(int numBirds)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic:**\n",
    "1. Generate a random chance (0-99)\n",
    "2. If it's 0-4 (5% chance): A bear visits → currentFood = 0\n",
    "3. Otherwise (95% chance): Birds visit\n",
    "   - Each bird eats the same random amount: 10-50 grams\n",
    "   - Calculate total eaten: `gramsPerBird × numBirds`\n",
    "   - If total eaten > currentFood: set currentFood to 0 (feeder emptied)\n",
    "   - Otherwise: subtract total from currentFood\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Implementation Details:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// 5% bear check\n",
    "int chanceValue = (int)(Math.random() * 100);\n",
    "if (chanceValue < 5) {\n",
    "    currentFood = 0;\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    // random grams per bird: 10-50 inclusive\n",
    "    int gramsPerBird = (int)(Math.random() * 41) + 10;\n",
    "    int totalEaten = gramsPerBird * numBirds;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // can't eat more than available\n",
    "    if (totalEaten > currentFood) {\n",
    "        currentFood = 0;\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        currentFood -= totalEaten;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B Solution: simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic:**\n",
    "1. Create a counter: `daysWithFood = 0`\n",
    "2. Loop up to `numDays` times:\n",
    "   - **Before each day:** Check if feeder is empty (currentFood ≤ 0)\n",
    "   - If empty: break out of loop (stop simulation)\n",
    "   - If there's food: call `simulateOneDay(numBirds)` and increment counter\n",
    "3. Return the count of days where food was available\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Implementation Details:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int daysWithFood = 0;\n",
    "for (int day = 0; day < numDays; day++) {\n",
    "    // Check BEFORE simulating the day\n",
    "    if (currentFood <= 0) {\n",
    "        break;  // No food left, stop early\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Simulate one day\n",
    "    simulateOneDay(numBirds);\n",
    "    daysWithFood++;\n",
    "}\n",
    "return daysWithFood;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Design?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Order Matters:**\n",
    "- We check if `currentFood <= 0` **before** calling `simulateOneDay`\n",
    "- This ensures we only count days where visitors actually found food\n",
    "- If the feeder empties on day 5, we stop and return 5 (not 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Walkthrough:**\n",
    "- Start: 300 grams, want to simulate 5 days with 8 birds\n",
    "- Day 1: 300g available → simulate → maybe 250g left, daysWithFood = 1\n",
    "- Day 2: 250g available → simulate → maybe 0g left, daysWithFood = 2  \n",
    "- Day 3: 0g available → break immediately (feeder is empty)\n",
    "- Return: 2 days with food\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Cases to Verify\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part A Test:**\n",
    "- Feeder with 500g, 12 birds, normal day should leave ~240-540g\n",
    "- Feeder should never go negative\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part B Test:**\n",
    "- Start with 1000g, simulate 10 days with 5 birds\n",
    "- Should return days until food runs out\n",
    "- Stopping early if feeder empties saves computation"
