    " * - Records plays that either score points or fail (end the turn)\n",
    " * - Provides formatted score information\n",

    " * Game Rules:\n",
    " * - Team 1 starts as the active team\n",
    " * - A play with points > 0: adds points to active team, team stays active\n",
    " * - A play with points == 0: no points scored, active team switches\n",

    "## How I Solved This Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whats actually happening\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, this is a scoreboard for a two-team game. The twist is that the teams take turns, and when one team fumbles (scores 0 points), the other team gets their chance. If they score, they keep going. It's like basketball—you keep your ball if you score, but you lose it if you miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data I'm Tracking** (Instance Variables)\n",
    "- Two team names (like \"Red\" and \"Blue\")\n",
    "- A score counter for each team\n",
    "- Which team gets to play right now (1 or 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting Up the Game** (Constructor)\n",
    "When I create a new game, I:\n",
    "- Store the team names\n",
    "- Set both scores to 0 (nobody's won yet)\n",
    "- Make team 1 the \"active\" team (they go first, always)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recording a Play** (The Core Logic)\n",
    "- **If someone scores points (not 0):** Add those points to whoever's turn it is, and they keep their turn\n",
    "- **If the play fails (0 points):** Don't add anything, and switch to the other team\n",
    "\n",
    "I use this little trick: `activeTeam = (activeTeam == 1) ? 2 : 1;` which just flips between 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting the Score** (What the User Sees)\n",
    "I just return a formatted string that shows: \"Team1Score-Team2Score-WhosTurnNow\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Runthrough w my algorithim\n",
    "Let me trace through what actually happens:\n",
    "1. New game starts: \"0-0-Red\" (Red has the ball)\n",
    "2. Red scores 1 point → \"1-0-Red\" (Red keeps the ball)\n",
    "3. Red attempts a play but fails (0 points) → \"1-0-Blue\" (Blue gets the ball)\n",
    "4. Blue scores 3 points → \"1-3-Blue\" (Blue keeps the ball)\n",
    "5. Blue scores 1 more → \"1-4-Blue\" (still Blue's turn)\n",
    "6. Blue fails → \"1-4-Red\" (Red gets it back)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the pattern now—it's all about momentum and mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Actually Tripped Me Up\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Confusing Part:** That 0-points parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, I was thinking about it wrong. It's not just \"no points were scored.\" It's more like \"the play failed, so the ball is turned over.\" The number 0 has this hidden meaning—it's not just data, it's a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was this weird? Because:\n",
    "1. Every play needs data (how many points), but 0 is doing double duty (it means both \"no points\" AND \"hand off the ball\")\n",
    "2. My brain wanted to switch teams every time, but actually teams only switch when points = 0\n",
    "3. Using 1 and 2 for the active teams works fine, but it requires you to remember the mapping in your head\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I Got It Right:**\n",
    "- I traced through every single test case manually\n",
    "- I realized that consecutive point-scoring plays DON'T change who's active\n",
    "- The ternary operator felt like the cleanest way to flip between 1 and 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Did It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yyayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! All the expected outputs match:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0-0-Red  ← Starting position\n",
    "1-0-Red  ← Red scores, keeps it\n",
    "1-0-Blue ← Red fails, Blue takes over\n",
    "1-3-Blue ← Blue scores twice in a row\n",
    "1-4-Red  ← Blue fails, Red gets it\n",
    "1-8-Red  ← More scoring and switching\n",
    "0-0-Lions ← New game, completely separate\n",
    "1-8-Red  ← Original game is untouched\n",
    "```"
